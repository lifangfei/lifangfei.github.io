<h1>About Virtual Reality</h1>
<h2>Virtual vs. Augmented vs. Mixed Reality</h2>
<div>
	What virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality all have in common is that they change the user’s perception of the world around them. With these technologies, the user perceives something in his or her world that doesn’t actually exist. For example, he or she could be experiencing a movie as part of it, enjoying the sun on a beach or having a virtual assistant help them with everyday life. Despite a fundamental similarity between these technologies, a common misconception is that virtual reality and augmented reality are the same.

	Virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality have core differences that surface in their infrastructure and applications. Virtual reality is where the user is immersed in an entirely artificial environment through an opaque screen. Nothing they see during the experience is actually happening or existent in their real world surroundings. Augmented and mixed reality bring artifice to the user’s normal world. Augmented reality is simply a visual overlay over reality for example having a screen showing your GPS directions with Google Glass or face-swap filters in Snapchat. Mixed reality, augmented reality’s cousin, occurs when the visual overlay is a virtual object that the user can then interact with.
